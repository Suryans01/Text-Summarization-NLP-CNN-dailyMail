# Text-Summarization-NLP-CNN-dailyMail
In the project using the BART model and the CNN and Daily Mail dataset, text summarization is the objective. The BART model, a powerful language model, will be fine-tuned on article-summary pairs. The dataset will be preprocessed to eliminate unnecessary elements like HTML tags and special characters. Training the BART model on this preprocessed dataset will establish its understanding of the relationship between articles and summaries. Encoding the input articles into smaller tokens, the BART model will generate summaries by leveraging its training to identify the most significant sentences. The generated summaries will then be decoded into readable text, providing concise and coherent summaries for the CNN and Daily Mail articles.
